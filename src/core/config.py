    Global Proton-Coop configurations.

    This class centralizes all static configuration values for the application,
    including paths to critical directories, lists of required external commands,
    and timeout settings. It also provides utility methods for path management
    and data migration.

    Attributes:
        SCRIPT_DIR (Path): The root directory of the script, correctly identified
            whether running from source or a PyInstaller frozen executable.
        PROFILE_DIR (Path): The directory where game profile `.json` files are stored.
        LOG_DIR (Path): The directory for storing application logs.
        PREFIX_BASE_DIR (Path): The base directory under which all Wine prefixes
            for different games are created.
        STEAM_PATHS (list[Path]): A list of common paths where Steam libraries
            may be installed. Used to locate Proton versions.
        REQUIRED_COMMANDS (list[str]): A list of essential command-line tools
            that must be present on the system for the application to function.
        OPTIONAL_COMMANDS (list[str]): A list of optional command-line tools.
        PROCESS_START_TIMEOUT (int): Timeout in seconds for waiting for a
            game process to start.
        PROCESS_TERMINATE_TIMEOUT (int): Timeout in seconds for waiting for a
            process to terminate gracefully.
        SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT (int): General timeout in seconds for running
            various subprocesses (e.g., `wineboot`, `winetricks`).
        FILE_IO_TIMEOUT (int): Timeout in seconds for file operations.
