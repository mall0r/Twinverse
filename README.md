**Twinverse** is an tool for Linux/SteamOS that allows you to create and manage multiple instances of `gamescope` and `steam` simultaneously. This enables multiple players to enjoy their game library on a single computer, either in split-screen mode or each with their own display, along with dedicated audio output and input devices.

## ✨ Key Features

Twinverse is designed as a flexible solution for simultaneous multi-gaming on Linux. Here are some of its main features:

1. **Simple Multi-Instance Management:** Run multiple Steam instances simultaneously, allowing you and your friends to enjoy your game libraries separately.
2. **Per-Instance Hardware Assignment:** Assign specific mice, keyboards, and controllers to each game instance. (Mouse/Keyboard can only be assigned to one instance at a time)
3. **Dedicated Audio Channels:** Route audio from each game instance to a separate audio output device.
4. **Separate Home Directory:** Twinverse allows you to have a new, separate home for each instance, enabling you to customize settings and files individually. (Does not interfere with your standard Home directory)
5. **Shared Game Library:** Twinverse allows you to share the Steam game directory among multiple instances, saving disk space and making game updates easier. (Users need to own the game in their Steam libraries to run it)
6. **Use Any Proton:** Twinverse lets you use any version of Proton to run your games, including custom protons like [ProtonGE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom).
7. **Play Whatever You Want:** Instances are not limited to playing the same game; each instance can play whichever game it wants (provided the user owns the game in their Steam library).
8. **Flexible Screen Modes:** Choose between splitscreen (up to 4 instances per monitor) or fullscreen (1 instance per monitor).

## 📦 Installation

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have installed the `gamescope`, `steam` and `mangoapp` packages native to your distro.
> SteamOS and Bazzite usually have all dependencies included by default.

Twinverse should work well on any system that supports `Gamescope` and `Steam`.

### Flatpak (Recommended)

The recommended way to install Twinverse is via Flatpak, which provides a sandboxed environment and easier updates.
<!--
**Option 1: Install from Flathub (Coming Soon)**
Once Twinverse is available on Flathub, you can install it using the following commands:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub io.github.mall0r.Twinverse
```-->

**Install from a .flatpak file**

1. **Download the Latest .flatpak file:**
   Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse/releases) page and download the latest `.flatpak` file.

2. **Install the Flatpak:**
   You can install the Flatpak with the following command:

   ```bash
   flatpak install --user Twinverse-*.flatpak
   ```

### AppImage

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the `bubblewrap` package installed.

Alternatively, you can use the AppImage version. This single file works on most modern Linux distributions without requiring system installation.

1. **Download the Latest AppImage:**
   Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse/releases) page and download the latest `.AppImage` file.

2. **Make it Executable:**
   After downloading, right-click the file, go to "Properties," and check the "Allow executing file as program" box. Alternatively, you can use the terminal:

   ```bash
   chmod +x Twinverse-*.AppImage
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   Run the AppImage and enjoy. That's it!

#### AppImage Integration (Optional)

For better system integration (e.g., adding a menu entry), you can use a tool like **[Gear Lever](https://github.com/mijorus/gearlever)** to manage your AppImage.

## 📖 How to Use?

Access our [Guide](https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse/blob/master/docs/GUIDE.md) for more information on how to use Twinverse.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Twinverse uses **Bubblewrap (`bwrap`)**, a low-level Linux sandboxing tool, to isolate each Steam Client instance. This ensures that the instances do not interfere with each other or with the user's main system. Furthermore, the `Gamescope` command line is dynamically generated based on the user's settings, involving the `bwrap` command which, in turn, launches `Steam`.

## 🛠️ For Developers

If you wish to contribute to Twinverse or run it directly from the source code, follow the instructions below.

### Running from Source

The `run.sh` script provides a quick way to set up a local environment and run the application. It will automatically create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse.git
cd Twinverse

# Run the launch script
./run.sh
```

### Building from Source

Twinverse provides a Makefile to manage builds and versioning. You can build the application using the following command:

```bash
make build
```

Alternatively, you can use the build script directly:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Packaging an AppImage

The `scripts/package-appimage.sh` script automates the process of creating an AppImage. It first runs the build script and then uses `linuxdeploy` to package the application into a distributable `.appimage` file.

```bash
make appimage
```

Or using the script directly:

```bash
./scripts/package-appimage.sh
```

### Packaging a Flatpak

The `scripts/package-flatpak.sh` script automates the process of creating a Flatpak. It will build the application and then package it into a `.flatpak` file.

```bash
make flatpak
```

Or using the script directly:

```bash
./scripts/package-flatpak.sh
```
