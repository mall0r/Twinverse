# What is Twinverse?

**Twinverse** is an tool for Linux/SteamOS that allows you to create and manage multiple instances of `Steam Big Picture` simultaneously. This enables multiple players to enjoy their game library on a single computer, either in split-screen mode or each with their own display, along with dedicated audio output and input devices.

</p>

> [!WARNING]
> This project does not support piracy; all players must own the game in their Steam libraries to be able to play it.

## ✨ Key Features

> [!NOTE]
> Mouse/Keyboard can only be assigned to one instance at a time

Twinverse is designed as a flexible solution for splitscreen gaming on Linux. Here are some of its main features:

1. **Multiple Instances:** Run multiple instances of Steam Client simultaneously

2. **Device Assignment:** Assign specific mouse, keyboard, and controller to each game instance

3. **Dedicated Audio Channels:** Direct audio from each instance to a separate audio output device

4. **Dedicated Home Directory:** Twinverse allows you to have a dedicated home directory for each instance, enabling individual customization of settings and files

5. **Shared Game Folder:** Share the Steam game directory across multiple instances, so you don’t need to download the game again for each instance, saving disk space

6. **Use Any Proton:** Twinverse lets you use any version of Proton to run your games, including custom protons like [ProtonGE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom)

7. **Play What You Want:** Instances are not limited to running the same game; each instance can run a different game

8. **Flexible Display Modes:** Choose between split screen (up to 4 instances per monitor) or full screen (1 instance per monitor)

## 📦 Requirements

To use Twinverse without issues, ensure the following requirements are met:

You need to have the *native* `gamescope` and `steam` packages from your distribution installed.

For Gamescope to function correctly, based on your GPU, you will need:

  - **AMD:** Mesa 20.3 or newer
  - **Intel:** Mesa 21.2 or newer
  - **NVIDIA:** Proprietary drivers 515.43.04 or newer, or NVIDIA Open Kernel Module drivers

> [!NOTE]
> *SteamOS* (AMD) and *Bazzite* generally have all dependencies included by default.

## 📦 Installation

### Flatpak

The recommended way to install Twinverse is via Flatpak, which provides a sandboxed environment and easier updates.
<!--
**Option 1: Install from Flathub (Coming Soon)**
Once Twinverse is available on Flathub, you can install it using the following commands:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub io.github.mall0r.Twinverse
```-->

**Install from a .flatpak file**

1. **Download the Latest .flatpak file:**
   Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse/releases) page and download the latest `.flatpak` file.

2. **Install the Flatpak:**
   You can install the Flatpak with the following command:

   ```bash
   flatpak install --user Twinverse-*.flatpak
   ```

### AppImage

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the `bubblewrap` package installed.

Alternatively, you can use the AppImage version. This single file works on most modern Linux distributions without requiring system installation.

1. **Download the Latest AppImage:**
   Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse/releases) page and download the latest `.AppImage` file.

2. **Make it Executable:**
   After downloading, right-click the file, go to "Properties," and check the "Allow executing file as program" box. Alternatively, you can use the terminal:

   ```bash
   chmod +x Twinverse-*.AppImage
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   Run the AppImage and enjoy. That's it!

#### AppImage Integration (Optional)

For better system integration (e.g., adding a menu entry), you can use a tool like **[Gear Lever](https://github.com/mijorus/gearlever)** to manage your AppImage.

### Running from Source

The `run.sh` script provides a quick way to set up a local environment and run the application. It will automatically create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse.git
cd Twinverse

# Run the launch script
./run.sh
```

## 📖 How to Use?

Access our [Guide](https://github.com/mall0r/Twinverse/blob/main/docs/GUIDE.md) for more information on how to use Twinverse.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Twinverse uses **Bubblewrap (`bwrap`)**, a low-level Linux sandboxing tool, to isolate each Steam Client instance. This ensures that the instances do not interfere with each other or with the user's main system. Furthermore, the `Gamescope` command line is dynamically generated based on the user's settings, involving the `bwrap` command which, in turn, launches `Steam`.
